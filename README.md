# Welcome! 👋

Your challenge is to build out this cool color generating website that helps the user to pick a color palette for their designs!

### Your users should be able to:
- Generate random colors at a click of a button
- Display the colors on the screen with their hexadecimal color representation

- Lock certain colors that they like. (When a color is locked, it won't change when user clicks the refresh button to generate new colors)

- Save color palette with a name to local storage

- User should be able to see all of their saved palettes and when clicked on one, it should update the containers to the palette selected.

### Bonus!
If you've finished the above requirements, awesome work!<br>
You can make your color picker project better by implementing the following:
- When clicking on any of the hexidecimal color codes, it should copy that color code to the clipboard
